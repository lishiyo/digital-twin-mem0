**Current Guide Section:** 
- Finished Task 2 (Minimal Infra Bootstrap) from `v0-tasks-backend.md`.
- Preparing to start Task 3 or Task 4.

**What's Working:**
- Local development environment setup (devcontainer/local Python).
- Docker Compose setup for Postgres, Redis, Neo4j.
- Basic FastAPI application (`app/main.py`) runs.
- Configuration loading (`app/core/config.py`) from `.env` works.
- Alembic is configured and initial migrations are applied.
- Database models (User, ChatMessage, Proposal, Vote) are created.
- Graphiti service (`app/services/graph/__init__.py`) connects to Neo4j and can add episodes.
- Test fixtures (`app/tests/conftest.py`) are set up.

**What's Broken/Incomplete:**
- `MemoryService` (`app/services/memory/__init__.py`) is a stub implementation.
- `GraphitiService` search functionality is basic.
- No actual Mem0 integration yet.
- Pre-commit hooks are currently disabled.

**Current Blockers:**
- None.

**Database/Model State:**
- PostgreSQL database `digitaltwin-mem0` exists.
- Tables created via Alembic for User, ChatMessage, Proposal, Vote models.
- Neo4j database is running and initialized with Graphiti indices/constraints.

**Pending Tasks:**
- Decide whether to proceed with Task 3 (Mem0 Wrapper) or Task 4 (Graphiti Wrapper refinement).
- Implement actual Mem0 client logic.
- Implement more advanced Graphiti service functions.
- Re-enable and fix pre-commit hook issues.

**What's Working:**
- Local development environment setup (devcontainer/local Python).
- Docker Compose setup for Postgres, Redis, Neo4j.
- Basic FastAPI application (`app/main.py`) runs.
- Configuration loading (`app/core/config.py`) from `.env` works.

- Database models (User, ChatMessage, Proposal, Vote) are created.
- Graphiti service (`app/services/graph/__init__.py`) connects to Neo4j and can add episodes.
- Test fixtures (`app/tests/conftest.py`) are set up.
- `MemoryService` (`app/services/memory/__init__.py`) is now fully implemented with:
  - All basic operations (add, search, add_batch)
  - Extended operations (get_all, get, update, history, delete, delete_all)
  - Error handling and logging
  - Fallback mechanisms for when the API is unavailable
  - Comprehensive test coverage

**What's Broken/Incomplete:**
- `GraphitiService` search functionality is basic.
- Pre-commit hooks are currently disabled.

**Current Blockers:**
- None.

**Database/Model State:**
- PostgreSQL database `digitaltwin-mem0` exists.
- Tables created via Alembic for User, ChatMessage, Proposal, Vote models.
- Neo4j database is running and initialized with Graphiti indices/constraints.
- Mem0 functionality is working, storing and retrieving memories.

**Pending Tasks:**

- Add importance scoring for memories.
- Add advanced metadata management.
- Re-enable and fix pre-commit hook issues.

**Current Guide Section:** 
- Completed Task 5 (File Upload Service & Basic Ingestion) from `v0-tasks-backend.md`.
- Preparing to start Task 6 (Refine Ingestion).

**What's Working:**
- Local development environment setup (devcontainer/local Python).
- Docker Compose setup for Postgres, Redis, Neo4j.
- Basic FastAPI application (`app/main.py`) runs.
- Configuration loading (`app/core/config.py`) from `.env` works.
- `MemoryService` fully implemented with error handling and optimizations.
- `GraphitiService` functioning with basic operations.
- File Upload API endpoints:
  - Single file upload: `/api/v1/upload`
  - Multiple file upload: `/api/v1/upload/batch`
  - Directory processing: `/api/v1/upload/process-directory`
  - Task status checking: `/api/v1/upload/task/{task_id}`
- Celery worker integration for asynchronous file processing.
- File validation, safety checking, and deduplication.
- Mem0 performance optimization (disabled inference to reduce API calls).

**What's Broken/Incomplete:**
- Graphiti still makes many OpenAI API calls during entity extraction.
- No proper virus scanning integration (using basic content safety checks).
- Pre-commit hooks are currently disabled.

**Current Blockers:**
- None.

**Database/Model State:**
- PostgreSQL database `digitaltwin-mem0` exists.
- Tables created via Alembic for User, ChatMessage, Proposal, Vote models.
- Neo4j database is running and initialized with Graphiti indices/constraints.
- Mem0 functionality is working, storing and retrieving memories.
- File processing pipeline (FileService → IngestionService → MemoryService → GraphitiService) functioning.

**Pending Tasks:**
- Implement Task 6 (Refine Ingestion):
  - Implement entity extraction from documents with spacy
  - Create relationships based on extracted entities
  - Optimize chunking strategies
  - Implement advanced deduplication
  - Add document metadata extraction
- Consider additional optimization for Graphiti's OpenAI API usage.
- Re-enable and fix pre-commit hook issues.
