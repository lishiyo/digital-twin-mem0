**Current Guide Section:** 
- Completed bug fix for ChatMessage field naming (bug_chat_message.md)
- Fixed asyncio event loop issue in Celery conversation summarization task

**What's Working:**
- Chat Log Ingestion with fixed field names:
  - Renamed `processed` to `processed_in_mem0` to indicate messages processed through Mem0 chat ingestion
  - Renamed `ingested` to `processed_in_summary` for messages included in summaries
  - Added new field `processed_in_graphiti` for messages processed through Graphiti
  - Properly labeled fields with comments to clearly explain their purpose
  - Created and applied Alembic migration (111d3837be93_rename_chat_message_fields.py)
  - Updated all relevant services to use the new field names
  - Added helper method `needs_summarization()` to the ChatMessage model
- Fixed bug in Celery task `_summarize_conversation_sync`:
  - Resolved "attached to a different loop" error in the conversation summarization task
  - Properly created isolated event loops for each task execution
  - Removed twin/assistant messages from mem0 and graphiti ingestion

**What's Broken/Incomplete:**
- UI updates for Chat Message details modal to show the new field names are in progress
- Knowledge viewer interface updates needed to display the correct processing status
- Need to verify all ingestion services are correctly checking and updating the new fields

**Database/Model State:**
