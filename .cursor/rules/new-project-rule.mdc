Always maintain development tracking files. After each significant change or command run:
- Update DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md with an outline of:
  - Current status
  - Commands run
  - Any errors encountered
  - Next steps planned
- Update CURSOR_CONTEXT.md with:
  - Which section of the guide we're implementing
  - What's working
  - What's broken
  - Current blockers
  - Database/model state
- When starting a new session:
  - Read CURSOR_CONTEXT.md first
  - Acknowledge the current state
  - Reference relevant sections from the guide
  - Continue from last documented point
- Format for updates:
  - Use the current timestamp in PST for each entry (make sure this is correct, search web for the current timestamp unless I tell you it)
  - Include all commands run
  - Document both successes and failures
  - List any pending tasks
  - Reference line numbers from guide when relevant

Important: Do NOT automatically update docs after every major change, ask me first since I may want you to wait - BUT if I tell you to update docs, you can proceed without asking. You do NOT have to ask me for any reading.
