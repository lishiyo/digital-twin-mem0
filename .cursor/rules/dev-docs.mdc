IMPORTANT: The following files in `dev_docs/` provide guidelines to navigate this codebase and remember what we are implementing. There may be additional documents on specific features, api etc that I will add explicitly, but these are core and you MUST read them before starting on a new task:
1. `v0_v1_strategy_shift.md`
   * foundation document that shapes all other fines
   * defines core requirements and goals
   * includes high-level implementation strategy
3. `v1_architecture.md`
   * System architecture
   * Key technical decisions
   * Design patterns in use
   * Key component and their interactions
4. `v1_tasks.md`
   * exact tasks and subtasks breakdown, as todo lists
   * todos should be checked off if implemented
   * lists critical implementation paths
5. `v1_api.md`
   * list of expected api endpoints for different components
5. `DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md` - our changelog
   * Current status - what's working, what's broken
   * Commands run
   * Evolution of project decisions
   * Next steps planned 
6. `CURSOR_CONTEXT.md`
   * Current work focus - which section of `v1_tasks.md` we are on
   * Recent changes
   * Active decisions and considerations
   * Important patterns and preferences
   * Learnings and project insights
   * Current database/model state

If touching chats or conversations, also review `v1_chat_ingestion.md`.

When starting a new session:
- Read `CURSOR_CONTEXT.md`, `DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md`, and `v1_tasks.md` first for the current state, what's been implemented, what to prioritize next
- Acknowledge the current state
- Reference relevant sections from these `dev_docs` files
- Format for updates to `CURSOR_CONTEXT.md` and `DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md`:
  - Use the current datetime in PST for each entry (use `date` in terminal for the current datetime unless I tell you it)
  - append new updates to TOP of those files, so that the top is the most recent

Important: When triggered by **update dev docs**, you MUST review every dev doc file, even if some don't require updates. Focus particularly on `DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md` and `CURSOR_CONTEXT.md` as they track current state.

### Documentation Updates

Update to these `dev_docs` files occur when:
1. Discovering new project patterns
2. After implementing significant changes
3. When user requests with **update dev docs** (MUST review ALL files)
4. When context needs clarification
5. When we've completed a task or subtask, update `v1_tasks.md`
